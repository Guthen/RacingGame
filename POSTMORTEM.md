## Post Mortem

### What did I learned while making this project?
+ Better Code Organization, Style & Usage for C# : #region, local functions, abstract keyword, attributes
+ Better Understanding & Usage of the MonoGame Framework
+ Understanding & Implementation of the Separating Axis Theorem for Collisions
+ Understanding & Implementation of Tiled Levels & Tileset (XML Parsing)

### Difficulties
+ Implementing Tiles Colliders (~10h) : had problems with merging adjacent tiles colliders together 
+ Implementing a Car AI (~7h) : had to revamp my car movement system to handle a directional vector and not a throttle and a steering factor
